 # Use -f or BIT_FILE to setup the wallet data file
 
 # Join the wallet from other copayer
   wallet -f pete.dat join JevjEwaaxW6gdAZjqgWcimL525DR8zQsAXf4cscWDa8u1qKTN5eFGSFssuSvT1WySu4YYLYMUPT

 # List pending TX Proposals
   wallet txproposals
   
 # Sign or reject TXs from other copayers

# Advanced Operation


[TODO]

# Airgapped Operation 

Air gapped (non connected) devices are supported. This setup can be useful if maximum security is needed, to prevent private keys from being compromised. In this setup, a device is installed without network access, and transactions are signed off-line. Transactions can be pulled from BWS using a `proxy` device, then downloaded to a pendrive to be moved to the air-gapped device, signed there, and then moved back the `proxy` device to be sent back to BWS. Note that Private keys are generated off-line in the airgapped device.

[TODO]


``` shell

# On the Air-gapped device
airgapped$ wallet genkey
airgapped$ wallet export -o toProxy  --access readwrite  #(or --readonly if proxy won't be allowed to propose transactions)

# On the proxy machine
proxy$ wallet import toProxy
proxy$ wallet join secret      # Or wallet create 
proxy$ wallet address          # Only if readwrite access was granted
proxy$ wallet balance

# Export pending transaction to be signed offline
proxy$ wallet txproposals -o txproposals.dat

## Back to air-gapped device

# Check tx proposals:
airgapped$  wallet txproposals -i txproposals.dat

# First time txproposals is running on the air gapped devices, the public keys of the copayers will be imported from the txproposals archive. That information is exported automatically by the proxy machine, and encrypted copayer's xpriv derivatives.

# Sign them
airgapped$  wallet sign  -i txproposals.dat -o txproposals-signed.dat

## Back to proxy machine

# Send signatures to BWS
proxy$  wallet sign -i txproposals-signed.dat
```
